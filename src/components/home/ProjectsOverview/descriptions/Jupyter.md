Our team is deeply involved in the development of the Jupyter project, at both technical and organizational levels, with several members participating in the project governance in various capacities.

We are responsible for some of the main innovations of the past years (JupyterLite, Collaborative editing in projectLab,the Voil√† dashboard system, the projectLab visual debugger).
