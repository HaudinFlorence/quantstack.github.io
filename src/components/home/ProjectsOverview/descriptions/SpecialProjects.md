Special projects leverage the open-source software stack that we
maintain. They can rely, for instance, on the JupyterLab
application framework and assemble JupyterLab components to produce
a different application.

              Such examples include:

              - Glue-Web: a JupyterLab extension to link visualisations of scientific datasets across many files,
              - JupyterCAD: a JupyterLab extension for collaborative 3D geometry modeling,
              - JupyterGIS : a JupyterLab extension for collaborative GIS (Geographical Information System) editor in Jupyter.
