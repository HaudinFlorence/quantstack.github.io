            QuantStack kickstarted the development of the xtensor and xsimd
            projects, popular C++ libraries meant for numerical analysis with
            multi-dimensional array expressions, and accelerated computing.
         
            xtensor provides:
            
            - an extensible expression system enabling lazy broadcasting,
          
            - an API following the idioms of the C++ standard library, <br />-
            tools to manipulate array expressions and build upon xtensor.
      
            The xsimd project provides a unified API for utilizing SIMD
            instructions of modern microprocessors.XSimd has seen a growing
            adoption in the past years, by projects such as Firefox, Krita,
            Pythran, and Apache Arrow.
