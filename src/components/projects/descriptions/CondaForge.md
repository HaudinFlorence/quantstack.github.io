QuantStack is one of the key organizations supporting the
conda-forge project, a community-led collection of recipes, build
infrastructure and distributions for the conda/mamba package
manager.

Adopted at the global scale, conda-forge has become the reference
source of build artifacts for the scientific computing ecosystem,
accounting for over 150 million package downloads monthly.

QuantStack developed key components of the conda-forge
infrastructure, including the mamba package manager and the
mamba-build utility, which underlie the build system of conda-forge.
QuantStack team members also maintain a large number of conda-forge
packages.
