            QuantStack is one of the main organizations supporting the Jupyter
            project, an open-source ecosystem of developer tools meant to
            improve the workflows of scientists and engineers.
        
            In the past years, Jupyter has become a de-facto standard in both
            industry and academia, at the foundation of the main open-source and
            commercial data science platforms, with millions of users. 
        
            The team comprises nine core contributors and maintainers the
            project. We are also behind popular extensions for data
            visualization, robotics, and dashboarding. 
         
            The QuantStack team is responsible for major evolutions in the
            project, such as the JupyterLab visual debugger, collaborative
            editing, or the development of JupyterLite.
