            QuantStack supports the open-source robotics ecosystem.
        
            We created the RoboStack distribution of ROS, the first conda/mamba
            based distribution of ROS, and the first cross-platform
            distribution of ROS. We are behind the jupyter-robotics project, a
            collection of JupyterLab and Jupyter extension integrating ROS with
            the Jupyter ecosystem.
