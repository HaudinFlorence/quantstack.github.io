JupyterGIS currently supports several vector processing and conversion tools such as buffer creation, centroid computation, and convex hull generation, similar to what QGIS offers. These features are powered by a GDAL WebAssembly (WASM) build and are currently available only through the JupyterGIS user interface.

We plan to extend these capabilities to the JupyterGIS Python API, enabling users to access the same processing tools programmatically, just as they would via the UI. This functionality will be implemented using the GDAL Python bindings.
