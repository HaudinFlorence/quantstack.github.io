 We develop new packages from the ground up. Such special projects built upon our open-source stack include:
          
- JupyterCAD,
- JupyterLab-ROS,
- Glue Web,
- ipygany
and many more.
          
You can contract with us to leverage the Jupyter, conda and the general PyData ecosystem in an optimal way.
